# Introducing Prose: A Content Editor for GitHub

## Easy editing of website content

Since the relaunch of developmentseed.org on Jekyll last fall, we have built many Jekyll sites hosted with the excellent GitHub Pages. This approach gives us great peace of mind. Generated static sites have fewer moving pieces and are cheaper to maintain, and retain great flexibility for building. GitHub’s native support for Jekyll removes the worry about setting up our clients with site generators. However, a main caveat with this architecture is the lack of a dedicated, fully integrated content editor. While our team is comfortable publishing to our blogs via a pull request, there are many others who would love to not worry about branching, committing, and merging to do so.

Prose is a content editor for GitHub-hosted Jekyll sites. Together with GitHub Pages’ native Jekyll support, it makes editing content on a Jekyll site simple.

You can try Prose by going to Prose.io, authenticating with your GitHub user account, and navigating to your Jekyll site. You can also read or fork its code from the Prose repository on GitHub.
